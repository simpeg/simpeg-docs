On each update, SimPEG is tested using the continuous integration service
`Travis CI <https://travis-ci.org/>`_. We use `Codecov <http://codecov.io>`_
to check and provide stats on how much of the code base is covered by tests.
This tells which lines of code have been run in the test suite. It does not
tell you about the quality of the tests run! In order to assess that, have a
look at the tests we are running - they tell you the assumptions that we do
not want to break within the code base.

Within the repository, the tests are located in the top-level **tests**
directory. Tests are organized similar to the structure of the repository.
There are several types of tests we employ, this is not an exhaustive list,
but meant to provide a few places to look when you are developing and would
like to check that the code you wrote satisfies the assumptions you think it
should.

All tests inherit from :code:`unittest` which is a part of core python.
Checkout the docs on `unittest
<https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/unittest.html>`_.


Compare with known values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In a simple case, you might know the exact value of what the output should be
and you can :code:`assert` that this is in fact the case. For example, in
`test_basemesh.py
<https://github.com/simpeg/discretize/blob/main/tests/base/test_basemesh.py>`_,
we setup a 3D :code:`BaseRectangularMesh` and assert that it has 3 dimensions.

.. code:: python

    import unittest
    import sys
    from discretize.base import BaseRectangularMesh
    import numpy as np

    class TestBaseMesh(unittest.TestCase):

        def setUp(self):
            self.mesh = BaseRectangularMesh([6, 2, 3])

        def test_meshDimensions(self):
            self.assertTrue(self.mesh.dim, 3)

The class inherits from :code:`unittest.TestCase`. When running the tests, the
:code:`setUp` is run first, in this case we attach a mesh to the instance of
this class, and then all functions with the naming convention :code:`test_XXX`
are run. Here we check that the dimensions are correct for the 3D mesh.

If the value is not an integer, you can be subject to floating point errors,
so :code:`assertTrue` might be too harsh. In this case, you will want to use a
tolerance. For instance in `test_maps.py <https://github.com/simpeg/simpeg/blob/main/tests/base/test_maps.py>`_


.. code:: python

    class MapTests(unittest.TestCase):

        # method setUp is used to create meshes

        def test_mapMultiplication(self):
            M = discretize.TensorMesh([2,3])
            expMap = maps.ExpMap(M)
            vertMap = maps.SurjectVertical1D(M)
            combo = expMap*vertMap
            m = np.arange(3.0)
            t_true = np.exp(np.r_[0,0,1,1,2,2.])
            self.assertLess(np.linalg.norm((combo * m)-t_true,np.inf),TOL)

These are rather simple examples, more advanced tests might include `solving an
electromagnetic problem numerically and comparing it to an analytical
solution <https://github.com/simpeg/simpeg/blob/main/tests/em/fdem/forward/test_FDEM_analytics.py>`_ , or
`performing an adjoint test <https://github.com/simpeg/simpeg/blob/main/tests/em/fdem/inverse/adjoint/test_FDEM_adjointEB.py>`_ to test :code:`Jvec` and :code:`Jtvec`.


.. _order_test:

Order and Derivative Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Order tests can be used when you are testing differential operators (we are using a second-order,
staggered grid discretization for our operators). For example, testing a 2D
curl operator in `test_operators.py <https://github.com/simpeg/discretize/blob/main/tests/base/test_operators.py>`_

.. code:: python

    import numpy as np
    import unittest
    from SimPEG.tests import OrderTest

    class TestCurl2D(OrderTest):
        name = "Cell Grad 2D - Dirichlet"
        meshTypes = ['uniformTensorMesh']
        meshDimension = 2
        meshSizes = [8, 16, 32, 64]

        def getError(self):
            # Test function
            ex = lambda x, y: np.cos(y)
            ey = lambda x, y: np.cos(x)
            sol = lambda x, y: -np.sin(x)+np.sin(y)

            sol_curl2d = call2(sol, self.M.gridCC)
            Ec = cartE2(self.M, ex, ey)
            sol_ana = self.M.edge_curl*self.M.project_face_vector(Ec)
            err = np.linalg.norm((sol_curl2d-sol_ana), np.inf)

            return err

        def test_order(self):
            self.orderTest()

Derivative tests are a particular type or :ref:`order_test`, and since they
are used so extensively, SimPEG includes a :code:`check_derivative` method.

In the case
of testing a derivative, we consider a Taylor expansion of a function about
:math:`x`. For a small perturbation :math:`\Delta x`,

.. math::

    f(x + \Delta x) \simeq f(x) + J(x) \Delta x + \mathcal{O}(h^2)

As :math:`\Delta x` decreases, we expect :math:`\|f(x) - f(x + \Delta x)\|` to
have first order convergence (e.g. the improvement in the approximation is
directly related to how small :math:`\Delta x` is, while if we include the
first derivative in our approximation, we expect that :math:`\|f(x) +
J(x)\Delta x - f(x + \Delta x)\|` to converge at a second-order rate. For
example, all `maps have an associated derivative test <https://github.com/simpeg/simpeg/blob/main/SimPEG/maps.py#L127>`_ . An example from `test_FDEM_derivs.py <ht
tps://github.com/simpeg/simpeg/blob/main/tests/em/fdem/inverse/derivs/test_F
DEM_derivs.py>`_

.. code:: python

    def derivTest(fdemType, comp):

        # setup problem, survey

        def fun(x):
            return survey.dpred(x), lambda x: prb.Jvec(x0, x)
        return tests.check_derivative(fun, x0, num=2, plotIt=False, eps=FLR)

.. _documentation:

Documentation
-------------

Documentation helps others use your code! Please document new contributions.
SimPEG uses `sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_ to build the documentation.
When documenting a new class or function, please include a description
(with math if it solves an equation), inputs, outputs and preferably a small example.

For example:

.. code:: python


    class WeightedLeastSquares(BaseComboRegularization):
        """
        L2 WeightedLeastSquares regularization with both smallness and smoothness (first order
        derivative) contributions.

        .. math::
            \phi_m(\mathbf{m}) = \\alpha_s \| W_s (\mathbf{m} - \mathbf{m_{ref}} ) \|^2
            + \\alpha_x \| W_x \\frac{\partial}{\partial x} (\mathbf{m} - \mathbf{m_{ref}} ) \|^2
            + \\alpha_y \| W_y \\frac{\partial}{\partial y} (\mathbf{m} - \mathbf{m_{ref}} ) \|^2
            + \\alpha_z \| W_z \\frac{\partial}{\partial z} (\mathbf{m} - \mathbf{m_{ref}} ) \|^2

        Note if the key word argument `mrefInSmooth` is False, then mref is not
        included in the smoothness contribution.

        :param discretize.base.BaseMesh mesh: SimPEG mesh
        :param IdentityMap mapping: regularization mapping, takes the model from model space to the thing you want to regularize
        :param numpy.ndarray indActive: active cell indices for reducing the size of differential operators in the definition of a regularization mesh
        :param bool mrefInSmooth: (default = False) put mref in the smoothness component?
        :param float alpha_s: (default 1e-6) smallness weight
        :param float alpha_x: (default 1) smoothness weight for first derivative in the x-direction
        :param float alpha_y: (default 1) smoothness weight for first derivative in the y-direction
        :param float alpha_z: (default 1) smoothness weight for first derivative in the z-direction
        :param float alpha_xx: (default 1) smoothness weight for second derivative in the x-direction
        :param float alpha_yy: (default 1) smoothness weight for second derivative in the y-direction
        :param float alpha_zz: (default 1) smoothness weight for second derivative in the z-direction
        """



.. _style:

Style
-----

Consistency make code more readable and easier for collaborators to jump in.
`PEP 8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ provides conventions for
coding in Python. SimPEG is currently not `PEP 8
<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ compliant, but we are working
towards it and would appreciate contributions that do too! If you have sublime text 3, the linter can be set up through sublime text 3's package manager. The step by step process is found :ref:`here <api_practices_linter_install>`.

Sublime has PEP 8 linter packages that you can use. I use `SublimeLinter-pep8 <https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter-pep8>`_.
You can install it by going to your package manager (`cmd + shift + p`),
install package and search for SublimeLinter-pep8. Installation instructions are available at https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter-pep8.

This highlights and gives you tips on how to correct the code.
