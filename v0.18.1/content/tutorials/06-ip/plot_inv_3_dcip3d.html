<p>Here we invert 5 lines of DC and IP data to recover both an electrical
conductivity and a chargeability model. We formulate the corresponding
inverse problems as least-squares optimization problems.
For this tutorial, we focus on the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Generating a mesh based on survey geometry</p></li>
<li><p>Including surface topography</p></li>
<li><p>Defining the inverse problem (data misfit, regularization, directives)</p></li>
<li><p>Applying sensitivity weighting</p></li>
<li><p>Plotting the recovered model and data misfit</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The DC data are measured voltages normalized by the source current in V/A
and the IP data are defined as apparent chargeabilities and V/V.</p>

<p>Inversion with SimPEG requires that we define the uncertainties on our data.
This represents our estimate of the standard deviation of the
noise in our data. For DC data, the uncertainties are 10% of the absolute value.
For IP data, the uncertainties are 5e-3 V/V.</p>

<h2>Plotting Normalized Data Misfit or Predicted DC Data<a class="headerlink" href="#plotting-normalized-data-misfit-or-predicted-dc-data" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>To see how well the recovered model reproduces the observed data,
it is a good idea to compare the predicted and observed data.
Here, we accomplish this by plotting the normalized misfit.</p>
