1D Forward Simulation for a Single Sounding
===========================================

Here we use the module *SimPEG.electromangetics.frequency_domain_1d* to predict
frequency domain data for a single sounding over a 1D layered Earth.
In this tutorial, we focus on the following:

    - Defining receivers, sources and the survey
    - How to predict total field, secondary field or ppm data
    - The units of the model and resulting data
    - Defining and running the 1D simulation for a single sounding

Our survey geometry consists of a vertical magnetic dipole source
located 30 m above the Earth's surface. The receiver is offset
10 m horizontally from the source.

Create Survey
-------------

Here we demonstrate a general way to define the receivers, sources and survey.
For this tutorial, the source is a vertical magnetic dipole that will be used
to simulate data at a number of frequencies. The receivers measure real and
imaginary ppm data.

Defining a 1D Layered Earth Model
---------------------------------

Here, we define the layer thicknesses and electrical conductivities for our
1D simulation. If we have N layers, we define N electrical conductivity
values and N-1 layer thicknesses. The lowest layer is assumed to extend to
infinity. If the Earth is a halfspace, the thicknesses can be defined by
an empty array, and the physical property values by an array of length 1.

In this case, we have a more conductive layer within a background halfspace.
This can be defined as a 3 layered Earth model.

Define the Forward Simulation, Predict Data and Plot
----------------------------------------------------

Here we define the simulation and predict the 1D FDEM sounding data.
The simulation requires the user define the survey, the layer thicknesses
and a mapping from the model to the conductivities of the layers.

When using the *SimPEG.electromagnetics.frequency_domain_1d* module,
predicted data are organized by source, then by receiver, then by frequency.
