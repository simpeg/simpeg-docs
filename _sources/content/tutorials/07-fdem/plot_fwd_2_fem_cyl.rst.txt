3D Forward Simulation on a Cylindrical Mesh
===========================================

Here we use the module *SimPEG.electromagnetics.frequency_domain* to simulate the
FDEM response for a borehole survey using a cylindrical mesh and radially symmetric
conductivity model. For this tutorial, we focus on the following:

    - How to define the transmitters and receivers
    - How to define the survey
    - How to solve the FDEM problem on cylindrical meshes
    - The units of the conductivity/resistivity model and resulting data


Please note that we have used a coarse mesh to shorten the time of the simulation.
Proper discretization is required to simulate the fields at each frequency with
sufficient accuracy.

Create Airborne Survey
----------------------

Here we define a x-offset borehole survey that consists of a single vertical line
of source-receiver pairs which measred the secondary magnetic flux density
 over a range of frequencies.

Create Cylindrical Mesh
-----------------------

Here we create the cylindrical mesh that will be used for this tutorial
example. We chose to design a coarser mesh to decrease the run time.
When designing a mesh to solve practical frequency domain problems:

    - Your smallest cell size should be 10%-20% the size of your smallest skin depth
    - The thickness of your padding needs to be 2-3 times biggest than your largest skin depth
    - The skin depth is ~500*np.sqrt(rho/f)

Create Conductivity/Resistivity Model and Mapping
-------------------------------------------------

Here, we create the model that will be used to predict frequency domain
data and the mapping from the model to the mesh. The model
consists of several layers. For this example, we will have only flat topography.

Simulation: Predicting FDEM Data
--------------------------------

Here we define the formulation for solving Maxwell's equations. Since we are
measuring the magnetic flux density and working with a conductivity model,
the EB formulation is the most natural. We must also remember to define
the mapping for the conductivity model. If you defined a resistivity model,
use the kwarg *rhoMap* instead of *sigmaMap*
