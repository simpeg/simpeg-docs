Testing
-------

    :target: https://dev.azure.com/simpeg/simpeg/_build/latest?definitionId=2&branchName=main

    :target: https://codecov.io/gh/simpeg/simpeg
    :alt: Coverage status

On each update, SimPEG is tested using the continuous integration service
`Azure pipelines <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/pipelines>`_.
We use `Codecov <http://codecov.io>`_ to check and provide stats on how much
of the code base is covered by tests. This tells which lines of code have been
run in the test suite. It does not tell you about the quality of the tests run!
In order to assess that, have a look at the tests we are running - they tell you
the assumptions that we do not want to break within the code base.

Within the repository, the tests are located in the top-level **tests**
directory. Tests are organized similar to the structure of the repository.
There are several types of tests we employ, this is not an exhaustive list,
but meant to provide a few places to look when you are developing and would
like to check that the code you wrote satisfies the assumptions you think it
should.

Testing is performed with :code:`pytest` which is available through PyPI.
Checkout the docs on `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/>`_.


Compare with known values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In a simple case, you might know the exact value of what the output should be
and you can :code:`assert` that this is in fact the case. For example,
we setup a 3D :code:`BaseRectangularMesh` and assert that it has 3 dimensions.

.. code:: python

    from discretize.base import BaseRectangularMesh
    import numpy as np

    mesh = BaseRectangularMesh([6, 2, 3])

    def test_mesh_dimensions():
        assert mesh.dim == 3

All functions with the naming convention :code:`test_XXX`
are run. Here we check that the dimensions are correct for the 3D mesh.

If the value is not an integer, you can be subject to floating point errors,
so :code:`assert ==` might be too harsh. In this case, you will want to use
the ``numpy.testing`` module to check for approximate equals. For instance,

.. code:: python

    import numpy as np
    import discretize
    from SimPEG import maps

    def test_map_multiplication(self):
        mesh = discretize.TensorMesh([2,3])
        exp_map = maps.ExpMap(mesh)
        vert_map = maps.SurjectVertical1D(mesh)
        combo = exp_map*vert_map
        m = np.arange(3.0)
        t_true = np.exp(np.r_[0,0,1,1,2,2.])
        np.testing.assert_allclose(combo * m, t_true)

These are rather simple examples, more advanced tests might include `solving an
electromagnetic problem numerically and comparing it to an analytical
solution <https://github.com/simpeg/simpeg/blob/main/tests/em/fdem/forward/test_FDEM_analytics.py>`_ , or
`performing an adjoint test <https://github.com/simpeg/simpeg/blob/main/tests/em/fdem/inverse/adjoint/test_FDEM_adjointEB.py>`_ to test :code:`Jvec` and :code:`Jtvec`.


.. _order_test:

Order and Derivative Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Order tests can be used when you are testing differential operators (we are using a second-order,
staggered grid discretization for our operators). For example, testing a 2D
curl operator in `test_operators.py <https://github.com/simpeg/discretize/blob/main/tests/base/test_operators.py>`_

.. code:: python

    import numpy as np
    import unittest
    from discretize.tests import OrderTest

    class TestCurl2D(OrderTest):
        name = "Cell Grad 2D - Dirichlet"
        meshTypes = ['uniformTensorMesh']
        meshDimension = 2
        meshSizes = [8, 16, 32, 64]

        def getError(self):
            # Test function
            ex = lambda x, y: np.cos(y)
            ey = lambda x, y: np.cos(x)
            sol = lambda x, y: -np.sin(x)+np.sin(y)

            sol_curl2d = call2(sol, self.M.gridCC)
            Ec = cartE2(self.M, ex, ey)
            sol_ana = self.M.edge_curl*self.M.project_face_vector(Ec)
            err = np.linalg.norm((sol_curl2d-sol_ana), np.inf)

            return err

        def test_order(self):
            self.orderTest()

Derivative tests are a particular type or :ref:`order_test`, and since they
are used so extensively, SimPEG includes a :code:`check_derivative` method.

In the case
of testing a derivative, we consider a Taylor expansion of a function about
:math:`x`. For a small perturbation :math:`\Delta x`,

.. math::

    f(x + \Delta x) \simeq f(x) + J(x) \Delta x + \mathcal{O}(h^2)

As :math:`\Delta x` decreases, we expect :math:`\|f(x) - f(x + \Delta x)\|` to
have first order convergence (e.g. the improvement in the approximation is
directly related to how small :math:`\Delta x` is, while if we include the
first derivative in our approximation, we expect that :math:`\|f(x) +
J(x)\Delta x - f(x + \Delta x)\|` to converge at a second-order rate. For
example, all `maps have an associated derivative test <https://github.com/simpeg/simpeg/blob/main/SimPEG/maps.py#L127>`_ . An example from `test_FDEM_derivs.py <ht
tps://github.com/simpeg/simpeg/blob/main/tests/em/fdem/inverse/derivs/test_F
DEM_derivs.py>`_

.. code:: python

    def deriv_test(fdemType, comp):

        # setup simulation, survey

        def fun(x):
            return survey.dpred(x), lambda x: sim.Jvec(x0, x)
        return tests.check_derivative(fun, x0, num=2, plotIt=False, eps=FLR)

.. _documentation:

Documentation
-------------

Documentation helps others use your code! Please document new contributions.
SimPEG tries to follow the `numpydoc` style of docstrings (check out the
`style guide <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`_).
SimPEG then uses `sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_ to build the documentation.
When documenting a new class or function, please include a description
(with math if it solves an equation), inputs, outputs and preferably a small example.

For example:

.. code:: python


    class WeightedLeastSquares(BaseComboRegularization):
        r"""Weighted least squares measure on model smallness and smoothness.

        L2 regularization with both smallness and smoothness (first order
        derivative) contributions.

        Parameters
        ----------
        mesh : discretize.base.BaseMesh
            The mesh on which the model parameters are defined. This is used
            for constructing difference operators for the smoothness terms.
        active_cells : array_like of bool or int, optional
            List of active cell indices, or a `mesh.n_cells` boolean array
            describing active cells.
        alpha_s : float, optional
            Smallness weight
        alpha_x, alpha_y, alpha_z : float or None, optional
            First order smoothness weights for the respective dimensions.
            `None` implies setting these weights using the `length_scale`
            parameters.
        alpha_xx, alpha_yy, alpha_zz : float, optional
            Second order smoothness weights for the respective dimensions.
        length_scale_x, length_scale_y, length_scale_z : float, optional
            First order smoothness length scales for the respective dimensions.
        mapping : SimPEG.maps.IdentityMap, optional
            A mapping to apply to the model before regularization.
        reference_model : array_like, optional
        reference_model_in_smooth : bool, optional
            Whether to include the reference model in the smoothness terms.
        weights : None, array_like, or dict or array_like, optional
            User defined weights. It is recommended to interact with weights using
            the `get_weights`, `set_weights` functionality.

        Notes
        -----
        The function defined here approximates:

        .. math::
            \phi_m(\mathbf{m}) = \alpha_s \| W_s (\mathbf{m} - \mathbf{m_{ref}} ) \|^2
            + \alpha_x \| W_x \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (\mathbf{m} - \mathbf{m_{ref}} ) \|^2
            + \alpha_y \| W_y \frac{\partial}{\partial y} (\mathbf{m} - \mathbf{m_{ref}} ) \|^2
            + \alpha_z \| W_z \frac{\partial}{\partial z} (\mathbf{m} - \mathbf{m_{ref}} ) \|^2

        Note if the key word argument `reference_model_in_smooth` is False, then mref is not
        included in the smoothness contribution.

        If length scales are used to set the smoothness weights, alphas are respectively set internally using:
        >>> alpha_x = (length_scale_x * min(mesh.edge_lengths)) ** 2
        """


.. _style:

Style
-----

Consistency makes code more readable and easier for collaborators to jump in.
`PEP 8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ provides conventions for
coding in Python. SimPEG is currently not `PEP 8
<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ compliant, but we are working
towards it and would appreciate contributions that do too! Often, most python
text editors can be configured to issue warnings for non-compliant styles.

SimPEG uses `black <https://black.readthedocs.io/>`_ version 23.1.0 to autoformat
the code base, and all additions to the code are tested to ensure that they are
compliant with `black`. We recommend installing `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_
hooks that are run on every commit to automatically ensure compliance.

We also actively update the code base to ensure pep8 compliance by checking with
`flake8 <https://flake8.pycqa.org/>`_ This performs style checks that could lead
towards bugs, performs checks on consistent documentation formatting, or just
identify poor coding practices. This is an ongoing process where we are fixing one
style warning at a time. The fixed style warnings are checked to ensure no new code
goes against an already established style. This test can also be installed locally
using pre-commit hooks, similar to `black` above.
