Getting Started: for Developers
===============================

- **Purpose:** To download and set up your environment for using and developing within SimPEG.

Installing Python

SimPEG is written in Python_! To install and maintain your Python_
environment, Anaconda_ is a package manager that you can use.
If you and Python_ are not yet acquainted, we highly
recommend checking out `Software Carpentry <http://software-carpentry.org/>`_.

Working with Git and GitHub

To keep track of your code changes and contribute back to SimPEG, you will
need a github_ account, then fork the `SimPEG repository <http://github.com/simpeg/simpeg>`_
to your local account.
(`How to fork a repo <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo>`_).


.. _github: http://github.com

Next, clone your fork to your computer so that you have a local copy. We recommend setting up a
directory in your home directory to put your version-controlled repositories (e.g.  called :code:`git`).
There are two ways you can clone a repository:

1. From a terminal (checkout: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git for an tutorial) ::

       git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/SimPEG

.. _SourceTree: https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/

.. _GitKraken: https://www.gitkraken.com/

2. Using a desktop client such as SourceTree_ or GitKraken_.

   If this is your first time managing a github_ repository through SourceTree_,
   it is also handy to set up the remote account so it remembers your github_
   user name and password

For managing your copy of SimPEG and contributing back to the main
repository, have a look at the article: `A successful git branching model
<http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>`_


.. _getting_started_setting_up_your_environment:

Setting up your environment
---------------------------

To get started developing SimPEG we recommend setting up an environment using the ``conda``( or ``mamba``)
package manager that mimics the testing environment used for continuous integration testing. Most of the
packages that we use are available through the ``conda-forge`` project. This will
ensure you have all of the necessary packages to both develop SimPEG and run tests
locally. We provide an ``environment_test.yml`` in the base level directory. ::

    conda env create -f environment_test.yml

.. note::
    If you find yourself wanting a faster package manager than ``conda``
    check out the ``mamba`` project at https://mamba.readthedocs.io/. It
    usually is able to set up environments much quicker than ``conda`` and
    can be used as a drop-in replacement (i.e. replace ``conda`` commands with
    ``mamba``).

There are many options to install SimPEG into this local environment, we recommend
using `pip`. After ensuring that all necessary packages from `environment_test.yml`
are installed, the most robust command you can use, executed from the base level directory
would be ::

    pip install --no-deps -e .

This is called an editable mode install (`-e`). This will make a symbolic link for you to
the working simpeg directory for that python environment to use and you can then
make use of any changes you have made to the repository without re-installing it. This
command (`--no-deps`) also ensures pip won't unintentionally re-install a package that
was previously installed with conda. This practice also allows you to uninstall SimPEG
if so desired ::

    pip uninstall SimPEG

.. note::
    We no longer recommend modifying your python path environment variable as a way
    to install SimPEG for developers.

.. _getting_started_jupyter_notebook:

Jupyter Notebook
----------------

The SimPEG team loves the `Jupyter notebook`_. It is an interactive
development environment. It is installed it you used Anaconda_ and can be
launched from a terminal using::

    jupyter notebook


.. _getting_started_if_all_is_well:

If all is well ...
------------------

You should be able to open a terminal within SimPEG/tutorials and run an example, ie.::

    python 02-linear_inversion/plot_inv_1_inversion_lsq.py

or you can download and run the :ref:`notebook from the docs <sphx_glr_content_tutorials_02-linear_inversion_plot_inv_1_inversion_lsq.py>`.

.. image:: /content/tutorials/02-linear_inversion/images/sphx_glr_plot_inv_1_inversion_lsq_003.png

You are now set up to SimPEG!

If all is not well ...
----------------------

Submit an issue_  and `change this file`_!

.. _issue: https://github.com/simpeg/simpeg/issues

Advanced: Installing Solvers
----------------------------

Pardiso_ is a direct solvers that can be used for solving large(ish)
linear systems of equations. The provided testing environment should install
the necessary solvers for you. pymatsolver_ If you wish to modify pymatsolver_ as well
follow the instructions to download and install pymatsolver_.

.. _Pardiso: https://www.pardiso-project.org

.. _pymatsolver: https://github.com/rowanc1/pymatsolver

If you open a `Jupyter notebook`_ and are able to run::

    from pymatsolver import Pardiso

.. _Jupyter notebook: http://jupyter.org/

then you have succeeded! Otherwise, make an `issue in pymatsolver`_.
