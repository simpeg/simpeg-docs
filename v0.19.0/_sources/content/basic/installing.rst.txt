Prerequisite: Installing Python
===============================

We highly recommend installing python using
`Anaconda <https://anaconda.com/download/>`_ (or the alternative
`Mambaforge <https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_).
It installs `python <https://www.python.org/>`_,
`Jupyter <http://jupyter.org/>`_ and other core
python libraries for scientific computing.

As of version 0.11.0, we will no longer ensure compatibility with Python 2.7. Please use
the latest version of Python 3 with SimPEG. For more information on the transition of the
Python ecosystem to Python 3, please see the `Python 3 Statement <https://python3statement.org/>`_.

Installing SimPEG
=================

Conda Forge
-----------

SimPEG is available through `conda-forge` and you can install is using the
`conda package manager <https://conda.io/>`_ that comes with the Anaconda
distribution:

.. code::

    conda install SimPEG --channel conda-forge

Installing through `conda`/`mamba` is our recommended method of installation.

.. note::
    If you find yourself wanting a faster package manager than ``conda``
    check out the ``mamba`` project at https://mamba.readthedocs.io/. It
    usually is able to set up environments much quicker than ``conda`` and
    can be used as a drop-in replacement (i.e. replace ``conda`` commands with
    ``mamba``).

PyPi
----

SimPEG is on `pypi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SimPEG>`_! First, make sure
your version of pip is up-to-date

.. code::

    pip install --upgrade pip

Then you can install SimPEG

.. code::

    pip install SimPEG


To update SimPEG, you can run

.. code::

    pip install --upgrade SimPEG


Installing from Source
----------------------

First (you need git)::

    git clone https://github.com/simpeg/simpeg

Second (from the root of the SimPEG repository)::

    pip install .

Success?
========

If you have been successful at downloading and installing SimPEG, you should
be able to download and run any of the :ref:`examples and tutorials<sphx_glr_content_examples>`.

If not, you can reach out to other people developing and using SimPEG on the
`google forum <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/simpeg>`_ or on
`slack <http://slack.simpeg.xyz>`_.
